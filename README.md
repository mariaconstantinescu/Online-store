# Project-6
I developed a website for my clothing brand using HTML.
The header section contains a carousel (#topg) displaying important messages related to shipping and sanitary precautions. There's also a navigation bar with links to the main categories of my clothing line.
The menu provides links to different sections of my website, including a link to the Editorial section.
The main content of my website includes sections titled "NEW IN" and "EDITORIAL." The "NEW IN" section has a carousel (#galerie) showcasing images of new products. The "EDITORIAL" section displays a series of images representing my brand's editorial content.
The footer is divided into three columns - "NEWSLETTER" for subscribing to newsletters, a section with various links including "Contact us" and "Legal terms and conditions," and a "FOLLOW US" section with links to social media profiles. There's also a dropdown menu for selecting the country or region.
I used vJavaScriptt to initialize and configure the Owl Carousel for both the top carousel (#topg) and the product carousel (#galerie). This provides dynamic and interactive features.
